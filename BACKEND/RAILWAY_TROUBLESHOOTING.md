# Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

## 🚨 **Current Error:**
```
npm run build --workspace=cafe-culture-backend
sh: 1: npm: not found
ERROR: failed to build: failed to solve: process "sh -c npm run build --workspace=cafe-culture-backend" did not complete successfully: exit code: 127
```

## 🔧 **Solutions to Try:**

### **Solution 1: Delete and Recreate Railway Project**
1. **Delete the current Railway project**
2. **Create a new Railway project**
3. **Upload only the BACKEND folder** (not the entire project)
4. **Set environment variables**

### **Solution 2: Use Docker Deployment**
1. **In Railway dashboard**, go to Settings
2. **Change deployment method to Docker**
3. **Railway will use the Dockerfile** instead of Nixpacks

### **Solution 3: Manual Configuration**
1. **In Railway dashboard**, go to Settings → Build
2. **Set Build Command**: `npm install`
3. **Set Start Command**: `node server.js`
4. **Disable auto-detection**

### **Solution 4: Alternative Platform**
If Railway continues to have issues, try:
- **Render.com** (free tier available)
- **Heroku** (has free tier)
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**

## 📋 **Current Configuration:**

### **package.json:**
```json
{
  "name": "cafe-culture-backend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "server.js",
  "type": "module",
  "engines": {
    "node": "18.x"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "dev": "nodemon server.js"
  }
}
```

### **railway.json:**
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "node server.js"
  }
}
```

## 🎯 **Recommended Next Steps:**

1. **Try Solution 1** (delete and recreate)
2. **If that fails, try Solution 2** (Docker deployment)
3. **If still failing, try Solution 3** (manual configuration)
4. **As last resort, try Solution 4** (alternative platform)

## 🔍 **Debug Information:**
- **Project Type**: Node.js Express API
- **Node Version**: 18.x
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Entry Point**: server.js
- **No build step required**

The error suggests Railway is still detecting workspace configuration somewhere. The solutions above should resolve this.
